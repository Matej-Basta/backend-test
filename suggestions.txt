This exchange library is slightly limited.

Firsty, even though we are able to support multiple APIs
at the same time, it is currently not possible to convert between currencies defined in separate exchange rate APIs.
I didn't dedicate much time into finding different APIs. I have used 1 additional one, but it was from the same provider
and the returned currencies were same as from the API you recommended. I implemented the second API, to illustrate
how the library could work with additional ones. However, this additional API did not allow me to try the conversion
between currencies from different sources, because they shared identical currencies. In order to accomplish the conversion
between multiple sources, we would need to find one currencly (e.g. USD) that would be included in both APIs and
use it as a bridging converter. (Example - 'From'=DKK 'To'=BTC -> Firstly converting DKK to USD and then using the 
amount of USD to convert it into BTC.)

Additional limitation is, that the current version of the library will support unlimited number of APIs
but with a condition, that the APIs must return the symbols under the keys "symbols" or "currencies" and
error messages under the keys "info" or "message". Moreover, new APIs must be provided with URLs, where all
the parameters (amount, from currency, to currency) must be replaced with specific placehodlers (placeholderAmount, placeholderFrom, placeholderTo),
because there is a function, that will replace the placeholders with the parameters, but only if they are written in this way.

Lastly, there are two considerations to tests.
Firstly, not all test branches are covered, because of the fact, that I was using two very similar APIs.
Secondly, considering the limitations of calling to the APIs, it is probably not optimal, that every test is calling
to the API to get the data. However, I have used this approach to make sure, that there should be no mistake.

Time of work - 2 hours and 45 minutes.
